        <h3>Recipe - Burrito:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Finely chop the onion and garlic.</dt>
            <dd><img src="../images/Burito_02.jpg" alt="Finely chop the onion and garlic" height="500" width="800"></dd>
            <dt>Saute the onion and garlic in vegetable oil for about 2 minutes over medium heat. After that, we put them in a plate.</dt>
            <dd><img src="../images/Burito_03.jpg" alt="Saute the onion and garlic" height="500" width="800"></dd>
            <dt>Cut the chicken into small pieces and fry in preheated vegetable oil over high heat for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Fry in small parts so that the meat gets a crust faster, which will not allow the juice to escape and the chicken will be juicier and softer. Add salt to taste and mix well.</dt>

            <dt>Add the onion, garlic and pepper, cut into strips, to the meat. Fry over medium heat for about 3 minutes.</dt>

            <dt>Add the beans, corn, cumin, ground chili pepper and tomatoes to the pan. I used canned tomatoes, but you can also use tomato puree or finely chopped tomatoes without the skin. Cumin should be ground or ground with your fingers to small grains. Mix well and fry over medium heat for another 3 minutes.</dt>

            <dt>Grate the cheese on a coarse grater, it is better to use the one that melts well when heated. Add the cheese to the pan and mix well.</dt>

            <dt>We wait for the cheese to melt and remove the pan from the heat.</dt>
