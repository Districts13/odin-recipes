    <h3>Recipe - Babaganush:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pierce the eggplants with a fork or knife in several places and place in an oven preheated to 180 degrees for half an hour. <br><img src="../images/Babaganush01.jpg" alt="Finely chop the onion and garlic"></li>
        <li>When ready, scoop out the flesh, being careful not to burn yourself, or leave to cool and remove when the eggplants are cold. The less purple skin that gets into the dish, the better: only the pulp is needed. <br><img src="../images/Babaganush02.jpg" alt="Saute the onion and garlic"></li>
        <li>In a blender, make a paste of sesame seeds, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper. Add eggplant and parsley and turn it all into a smooth puree. <br><img src="../images/Babaganush03.jpg" alt="Cut the chicken into small pieces"></li>
